# My dotfiles

You can find here all my config files.

Since it's the first time I'm using a dedicated repository to store
and retrieve these files it will probably change a lot.

For now I plan to have different branches for the differents OS I use.

I also think that it could be a good way to manage different config states.

## Shell

I'm using [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) coupled with the [Oh-my-zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/) plugin manager.

I also use [starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt.

> [!TIP]
> Since I liked the "transient prompt" feature from the well-known [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme, I'm thinking about switching to fish. Transient prompts are not currently supported by starship on zsh for now.

## Tools

Here is a list of tools I use:

- Aerospace to manage workspaces on MacOs
- Bat for a better `cat` command
- Btop
- Kitty (but I mainly use iTerm2 and Warp)
- Neovim
- Yazi
- Zellij
